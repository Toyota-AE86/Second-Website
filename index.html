       The AE86 generation of the Toyota Corolla Levin and Toyota 
  Sprinter Trueno is a small, lightweight coupe or hatchback introduced 
  by Toyota in 1983 as part of the fifth generation Toyota Corolla lineup. 
  For the purpose of brevity, the insider-chassis code of "AE86" depicts 
  the 1600 cc RWD model from the range. In classic Toyota code, the "A" 
  represents the engine that came in the car (4A series), "E" represents 
  the Corolla, "8" represents the fifth generation (E80 series) and "6" 
  represents the variation within this generation.</div>
